ESMPy is the Python interface for the Earth System Modelling Framework (ESMF) regridding utility. You can find out more [here](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/esmpy/). This repository contains a brief tutorial on how you can use this package to do some common regridding tasks. These examples use data from numerical weather prediction models as well as surface station, all which are included. Take a look at the Jupyter Notebook and see how to use the package. Happy regridding!
